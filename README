In this web-scraping application, the user is able to search for any current or
former NFL player on the local host and return the same results as seen on the
NFL.com website.

The application assumes the player is a current one unless the user checks a box
to indicate the player is no longer active.

The URLs contained within the results are functional, taking the user to the
various additional pages for career stats and team stats.
